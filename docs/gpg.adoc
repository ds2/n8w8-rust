= GPG

This section sets up GPG with you.

== Set up GPG directory with your keys

[,shell]
----
export SRC_DIR=$(pwd) # that usually is your workspace directory
export GNUPGHOME=${SRC_DIR}/repository/gpg
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
install -m 0700 -d $GNUPGHOME
----

== Create Key to sign everything

[,shell]
----
gpg --no-default-keyring --full-generate-key
# use RSA, 4096
# use expiry: 2y
# use name: Test Signing
# use email: rpmsign@my.domain
# use comment: just a test signer
# use pw: whatever you like
# NOTE THE FINGERPRINT ID AT THE END!!
export FPR='MYFINGERPRINT'

# restart gpg agent and let it know the terminal size
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent

# test signing
echo "test" | gpg --clearsign
----

The last command should start the pinentry window and ask for the gpg key password. At the end, you should get a gpg signature.

If you get an error message saying that the _Screen or window too small_ simply put the terminal in full window mode and restart gpg-agent.
