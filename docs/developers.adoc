== For developers

This section is for contributing developers.

=== New modules

You can create new modules by executing:

[,shell]
----
cargo new --lib MYMODULE
----

You can also use _--bin_ to create a binary/binaries.

After that you may edit the _Cargo.toml_ file and add the subproject as a workspace member to the list of subprojects.
