== For developers

This section is for contributing developers.

=== Installing the hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to set up some rules upfront. Please install https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit] first, and then run the configuration installation:

[,shell]
----
pre-commit install
----

Now, everytime when you commit something, some local checks will be done before the commit finally gets accepted.

To test your commit with the hooks, you can run:

[,shell]
----
pre-commit run --all-files
----

=== New modules

You can create new modules by executing:

[,shell]
----
cargo new --lib MYMODULE
----

You can also use _--bin_ to create a binary/binaries.

After that you may edit the _Cargo.toml_ file and add the subproject as a workspace member to the list of subprojects.
