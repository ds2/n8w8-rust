== With Dapper

To build the project via https://github.com/rancher/dapper[Dapper], you simply run:

[,shell]
----
dapper
----

To have a shell inside dapper, run:

----
dapper -s
----

Be aware that Dapper does not run the _/entrypoint.sh_ script. You may want to _source_ it.
As we are using a very different user to build the binaries
within Dapper, you may need to chown some files:

[,shell]
----
sudo chown -r rusty .
----
