## Note: Any command which fails in any stage below result in the command stopping, and endStage being run.
## A flow file can have one or more stages, each with multiple "actions",
## or your flow file can have multiple stages with fewer actions in each stage.
stages:


  ## The first stage of actions.
  Default:

    actions:
      #
      # Quality Checks for changelog
      #
      - type: liquibase
        command: checks run
        cmdArgs: {checks-scope: changelog}
      #
      # Run the update
      #
      - type: liquibase
        command: update

      #
      # Quality Checks for database
      #
      - type: liquibase
        command: checks run
        cmdArgs: {checks-scope: database}


## The endStage ALWAYS RUNS.
## So put actions here which you desire to perform whether previous stages' actions succeed or fail.
## If you do not want any actions to ALWAYS RUN, simply delete the endStage from your flow file.

endStage:
  actions:
    - type: liquibase
      command: history
